# HighPerformanceSecurity

Note this code is taken from JGDMS to demonstrate the security technologies utilised by that project, so they are more readable and understandable.  This is not intended for production as test code hasn't been copied across.  If you want to use these libraries they can be found on Maven Central by adding the following dependency:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>au.net.zeus.jgdms</groupId>
            <artifactId>jgdms-platform</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
