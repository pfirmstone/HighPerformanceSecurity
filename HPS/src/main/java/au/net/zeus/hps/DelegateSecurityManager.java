/**
 * The DelegateSecurityManager is designed to enable the use of 
 * Delegate decorators to encapsulate security sensitive objects using
 * Li Gong's method guard pattern.
 * <p>
 * In this manner we can prevent references to security sensitive object's from 
 * escaping.
 * <p>
 * See "Inside Java 2 Platform Security" 2nd Edition, ISBN:0-201-78791-1, page 176.
 * <p>
 * Delegate implementations are available separately from the JGDMS
 * release at <a href="river.apache.org">Apache River</a>.
 * <p>
 * Delegates can be enabled at runtime by using the DelegateSecurityManager,
 * but only for code that utilises delegates.
