/**
 * Interface that a security manager or policy provider can optionally
 * implement in order to support the saving and restoring of custom security
 * context state.  If the installed security manager or policy provider
 * implements this interface, then its <code>getContext</code> method is
 * delegated to by the corresponding method of the
 * {@link net.jini.security.Security} class, with precedence given to the
 * security manager.
 * <p>
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by security managers and policy
 * providers whose security contexts include state in addition to that provided
 * by {@link java.security.AccessControlContext}.  For example, a security
 * policy provider that considers thread local values when evaluating security
 * checks may want to include those values in snapshots of the current security
 * context, so that they can be properly restored when the context is
 * reapplied--it can achieve this by implementing the <code>getContext</code>
 * method to return a {@link SecurityContext} instance containing the
 * snapshotted thread local values as well as the current access control
 * context, with <code>wrap</code> methods implemented to return privileged
 * action wrappers that properly restore the thread local state.
