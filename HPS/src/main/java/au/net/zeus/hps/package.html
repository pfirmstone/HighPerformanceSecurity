This package contains a scalable cache based security manager that parallelises
domain security checks.  Also included is a concurrent
policy file provider to replace Java's standard offering, this policy provider
is in theory much faster after policy file parsing is complete, it uses an immutable data 
structure that supports highly scalable concurrent access and does not require
further disk access and minimises network and DNS requirements.
    </p><p>
Disk access of policy files is performed serially.
